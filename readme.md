# Setup

Make sure required packages have been installed by using the Python terminal and typing the following:

1. pip install numpy
2. pip install matplotlib
3. pip install scipy

If you are using an IDE and have the file open within the IDE with the required packages installed, you should be able to press run and view a graph.

If not, you should open a terminal, navigate to where the file is saved and attempt to run it from there.
